This guide focuses on solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems with an emphasis on arrays, which are fundamental in programming. It covers key concepts such as array basics, common operations like insertion, deletion, searching, and sorting, and introduces problem-solving techniques such as the two-pointer method, sliding window, and prefix sums. Key problems include finding duplicates, calculating the maximum subarray sum using Kadaneâ€™s algorithm, rotating arrays, and merging overlapping intervals. To enhance understanding, regular practice on platforms like LeetCode, analyzing diverse solutions, and visualizing operations are recommended. Mastering these aspects will build a solid foundation for tackling advanced data structures and algorithms, ultimately improving coding proficiency and problem-solving skills.
